# get_the_excerpt

Renders the excerpt.

Note that if you don't provide an excerpt (fill out the excerpt meta box), WordPress will automatically generate one from the content box (provided it has been filled out).

It only returns HTML, meaning this is very useful if you want to render a text excerpt without having to worry about content other than text, like picture galleries.
