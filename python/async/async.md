# Asynchronous code

Tasks that would normally require the use of asynchronous code:

- the data from the client to be sent through the network
- the data sent by your program to be received by the client through the network
- the contents of a file in the disk to be read by the system and given to your program
- the contents your program gave to the system to be written to disk
- a remote API operation
- a database operation to finish
- a database query to return the results
